### Features
- One random player will receive a battery when the match starts.
- The goal is to pass the battery to another player by meleeing them or throwing a pulse blade before the timer ends.
- By default, the battery explodes in 30 seconds.

### Gameplay Mechanics
- Every player spawns with a Wingman B3 and Stim.
- Wingman B3 has 1 bullet and a very slow reload time.
- Shooting an enemy with the Wingman stuns them for 2.5 seconds. (Think of Arc Grenade stuns)
- The player with the battery gains a Pulse Blade.
- If the Pulse Blade lands on an enemy, the battery is immediately transferred to the target.
- Dead players will be forced to spectate until the match is over.
